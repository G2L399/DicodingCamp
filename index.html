              SN 1604, also known as Kepler's Supernova, Kepler's Nova or
              Kepler's Star, was a Type Ia supernova that occurred in the Milky
              Way, in the constellation Ophiuchus. Appearing in 1604, it is the
              most recent supernova in the Milky Way galaxy to have been
              unquestionably observed by the naked eye, occurring no farther
              than 6 kiloparsecs (20,000 light-years) from Earth. Before the
              adoption of the current naming system for supernovae, it was named
              for Johannes Kepler, the German astronomer who described it in De
              Stella Nova.

              This comet, known for its strikingly bright tail, was visible in
              December 1680. It captivated observers and was among the first
              comets to be studied with a telescope.

              The Leonid Meteor Shower of November 1833 created a spectacle as
              thousands of meteors lit up the sky every hour. This event spurred
              advancements in meteor science.

              In March 1843, a comet with an exceptionally long tail, measuring
              over 2 astronomical units, became a breathtaking sight, especially
              in the southern hemisphere.

              On December 21, 2020, Jupiter and Saturn appeared a mere 0.1

              popularly called the "Christmas Star."
