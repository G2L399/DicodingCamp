              Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the
              Solar System. In English, it is named after the ancient Roman god
              Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, and the
              messenger of the gods. Mercury is classified as a terrestrial
              planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. The surface
              of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact
              events that have accumulated over billions of years. Its largest
              crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi),
              which is about one-third the diameter of the planet (4,880 km or
              3,030 mi). Similarly to the Earth's Moon, Mercury's surface
              displays an expansive rupes system generated from thrust faults
              and bright ray systems formed by impact event remnants.
              <br /><br />Mercury's sidereal year (88.0 Earth days) and sidereal
              day (58.65 Earth days) are in a 3:2 ratio. This relationship is
              called spinâ€“orbit resonance, and sidereal here means "relative to
              the stars". Consequently, one solar day (sunrise to sunrise) on
              Mercury lasts for around 176 Earth days: twice the planet's
              sidereal year. This means that one side of Mercury will remain in
              sunlight for one Mercurian year of 88 Earth days; while during the
              next orbit, that side will be in darkness all the time until the
              next sunrise after another 88 Earth days.
